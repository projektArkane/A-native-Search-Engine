# This is a Search-Engine. It's called Findia.

* #### Currently, It is in its very early development phase. :hammer_and_wrench:
* #### The aim is to build a native search engine for our country and to reduce our dependency on other nations.
* #### Right now it works, but is a dummy and uses DuckDuckGo (An another search engine) to fetch it's search results.
* #### I'm trying to implement newer searching and ranking algorithms which have been developed recently; Harmonic Centrality to be specific; which in conjecture is a better  algorithm than Pagerank, the one using which Google was built. I will highly appreciate any kind of help. We can work together to first build a working engine and then scale it later.
#### Note : The goal is not to compete with the big players in the market like Google or Bing (that's a little too far-fetched right now), but to build something which we can proudly call our own.
##### *psst!, but don't worry, every empire has to fall one day; what goes up must come down! What we can do at the least is, look for opportunities and give our best.* :100:
