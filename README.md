# This a Search-Engine. It's called Findia.
#### Currently, It is in a very early development phase.
#### The aim is to build a native search engine for our country and to reduce our dependency on other nations.
#### Right now it works, but is a dummy and uses DuckDuckGo (An another search engine) to fetch it's search results.
#### I'm trying to implement newer searching and ranking algorithms which have been developed recently; Harmonic Centrality to be specific; which in conjecture is a better algorithm than Pagerank, the one using which Google was built. I will highly appreciate any help from anyone. We can work together to first build a working engine and then scale it later.
### Note : The goal is not to compete with the big players in the market like Google or Bing and to monetize it (that's a little too far-fetched right now), but to build something which we can proudly call our own.
##### *psst!, but don't worry, what goes up must come down! Every empire has to fall one day. There's always hope to build something better than the best.*
